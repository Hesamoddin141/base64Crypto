# base64Crypto
This tool allows you to choose between Base64 encoding and decoding. It uses Python's built-in base64 library to transform text, images, or videos into Base64-encoded text and back again. The encoding is based on a set of 64 characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, +, and /.

Features:
Base64 Encoding: Convert text, images, or other binary data into Base64 format.
Base64 Decoding: Convert Base64-encoded text back into its original form.
Usage:
Choose whether to encode or decode.
Enter your text or Base64-encoded string.
The program will return the result based on your input.
